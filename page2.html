                <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I'm interested in a lot of things. Lately I've been more interested in photography because I think it's a good skill to develop. Somewhat related to the photography topic are video games. The beauty of the nature around us is captured in an interactive 3D enviroment. I'd say that playing video games is one of my hobbies. The problem with modern story-driven video games is that completing the main story takes a lot of time. If you are looking for a shorter game, it's often puzzle game. The following table lists 3 video games and you can probably guess which falls into the puzzle category.</p>
