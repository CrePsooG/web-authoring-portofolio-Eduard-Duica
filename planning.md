## General design:

- a nav with links to different pages
- 2 boxes, slightly transparent:
    - one main box with the main topic of the page
    - second smaller box on the right next to the main box
- a footer with the a symbol and some text
- and a background picture

## Navigation:
I chose a navigation system with buttons and links because it's easy to use and understand. 

In order to go to the **Home** page you can: 
- click the name of the website (top left)
- use the nav system above main left box and click **Home**
- use Home button or link that is present on every page (near the bottom of the page exept the Home page)

For viewing other pages you can:
- click the buttons on the **Home** page
- click the **Learn more** link that is located in the small left box on the page

 ## Evolution of HTML and CSS
 

## HTML tags to be used effectively: 
- **&lt;h1&gt;** to **&lt;h6&gt;** tags for titles
- **&lt;p&gt;** tags for paragraphs
- **&lt;a&gt;** tags for links and buttons
- **&lt;ul&gt;** and **&lt;ol&gt;** for unordered lists and ordered lists
- **&lt;li&gt;** tags for list items

## CSS properties to be implemented:
- **color** property for text color
- **background-color** property for the background color of the boxes and buttons
- **text-align** property for aligning text in the center
- **padding** property for padding inside of the boxes
- **box-sizing** property to allow me to include padding without making the boxes bigger
