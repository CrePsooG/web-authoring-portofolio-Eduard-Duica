## General design:

- a nav with links to different pages 
- 2 boxes, slightly transparent:
    - one main box with the main topic of the page
    - second smaller box on the right next to the main box
- a footer with the a symbol and some text
- and a background picture

## Navigation:
I chose a navigation system with buttons because it's easy to use and understand. In order to go the main page you can: 
- click the name of the website (top left)
- use home button that is present on every page (near bottom page)
- use the nav system above main left box
